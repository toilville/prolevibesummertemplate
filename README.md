Built by workers, for workers. Twining is about making technology accessible and useful for everyday people, not just the tech elite.

## What's This About?

- **For the people** - No corporate BS, just honest tools
- **By the people** - Built in spare time by folks who actually use this stuff
- **Keep it simple** - If your grandma can't figure it out, we're doing it wrong
- **Actually useful** - Solving real problems, not Silicon Valley fantasies

## About

This is a grassroots project that emerged from actual need, not venture capital fever dreams. We're building something that matters to regular people trying to get work done.

## Getting Started

### What You Need

Just the basics - we're not here to make you install 47 different tools just to say hello world.

- A computer (obviously)
- Basic command line knowledge (if you can `cd` and `ls`, you're good)
- Some free time and curiosity

---

### Installation

No complicated setup scripts or enterprise deployment nonsense:

```bash
# Grab it
git clone https://github.com/[username]/twining.git
cd twining

# That's probably it
# (We'll add actual setup steps as we build this thing)
```

## Usage

We're still building this, but the goal is dead simple:

```bash
# It should be this easy
twining do-the-thing
```

*More docs coming as we actually write the code*
